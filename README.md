# SPM Checker

Do you find technology multiplier setting boring? Are you infuriated that it doesn't make the game more difficult, just makes you wait more? This is the mod for you!

## What does it do?

By default settings (changeable in mod settings), all science spoils in 5 minutes. Produced SPM is measured every 0.5 seconds, you can see it in the SPM Checker window.
When you start a research, you will see the required SPM for each science type and a graphic representation of how much you are fullfiling it.

If you are not meeting the requirements, there is a grace period of 10 seconds (changable in settings) where you can get the SPM back up.
If it doesn't go back to meeting requirements, research is canceled.

## Multiplayer

Should work fine but not tested.

## Compatibility with other mods

Should work with all mods.
